10. Write a PHP program to sort an array of positive integers using the Bead-Sort Algorithm.
According to Wikipedia "Bead-sort is a natural sorting algorithm, developed by Joshua J. Arulanandham, Cristian S. Calude and Michael J. Dinneen in 2002. Both digital and analog hardware implementations of bead sort can achieve a sorting time of O(n); however, the implementation of this algorithm tends to be significantly slower in software and can only be used to sort lists of positive integers".

Input array : Array ( [0] => 5 [1] => 3 [2] => 1 [3] => 3 [4] => 8 [5] => 7 [6] => 4 [7] => 1 [8] => 1 [9] => 3 )
Expected Result : Array ( [0] => 8 [1] => 7 [2] => 5 [3] => 4 [4] => 3 [5] => 3 [6] => 3 [7] => 1 [8] => 1 [9] => 1 )
